    <h3>An imaginative inventor furthers local developments on a new model of people-moving.</h3>
    <h2>The Inventor - Union Station - 10:00am - April 10, 1893</h2>

    <p class="copy">Tapping a pencil on the armrest of the train seat, the man pores over his plans. He is beyond determined to see them actualized. The door to his cabin slides open and a man thrusts his head in “Queen City in five minutes, Sir!” The man nods and gathers up the documents. “Thank you.”</p>
    <p class="copy">Alfred Ward Swan was an inventor’s inventor. He loathed even the idea of rest and by the age of 28, Mr. Swan held several patents to noteworthy inventions. In his youth, he was a carom billiard enthusiast. His most whimsical early invention was a set of vulcanized rubber billiard balls used for a nine-pocket table. This frivolous invention led to his greatest achievement. Perhaps one of the greatest inventions of the Gilded Age. While trying to perfect an internal ball-return system within a billiard table, Swan experimented with several modern mechanical advantages. Suction and propulsion techniques could quickly and efficaciously return the cue ball on a faulted play. His claim, “Little more is required than a tube, a ball, and a fan!” to his fellow players, shifted something within him. What if he were to use this principle on a larger scale?</p>
    <p class="copy">Being a regular in the gaming parlors, Swan secretly appealed to several prominent men to lend use of the land beneath properties adjacent to New York’s City Hall. His intention – to experiment with a “Pneumatic Tube Transit System”. Wholly dedicated to the success of his project, a grand solution to New York City's busy streets, Swan sold his kidney to finance the initial leg of the work. Once ground was broken in the winter of 1869, providence moved in and the project was realized within a year’s time.</p>
    <p class="copy">In the February of 1870, Swan unveiled the block-long transit system to an awestruck public. The elegant station, equipped with a player piano, a goldfish-stocked fountain and &mdash; of course &mdash;  billiard tables, invited riders into the footloose and fancy-free joyride of pneumatic travel. Swan's invention was a the talk of the town in the Big Apple. In its first six months of operation, 200,000 riders each paid a quarter to enjoy a clean, quiet, smooth ride – the future of travel.</p>
    <p class="copy">It seemed as though Swan's invention would succeed when legislation was initiated to implement the system city-wide. However, proponents of a plan to lay elevated railway tracks across Manhattan were threatened by Swan's efforts. Despite their political influence, Swan was prepared to fight to the bitter end. But the bitter end came in a manner he did not expect. September 18, 1873 marked the beginning of The Long Depression. Swan's investors remorsefully pulled backing from the project. The tunnels of the Pneumatic Tube Transit System were bricked over, creating a crypt for Swan's broken dream.</p>

    <h3>The Queen City Pneumatic Transit System explained.</h3>
    <h2>The Inventor - Burlington - 11:00am - April 10, 1893</h2>

    <p class="copy">Resolved to redeem his tubal genius, Swan negotiated with the high officials of Queen City to implement his visionary transit system. The proposal came with a promise to carry forth Queen City as the City of The Future. Not only would the tube system be subterranean, it would be subaqueous. Shaped like a crescent, the tube’s route included approximately two miles of transparent tunnel for riders to view the depths of Lake Champlain while traveling to the popular amusement park at Juniper Island. The system provided timely, safe travel between six key locations –</p>

    <h3>In which a conductor decides on a career switch.</h3>
    <h2>The Pilot - Union Station - 3:00pm - September 15, 1893</h2>

    <p class="copy">Benjamin Isham was tired of railroad work. He had been a conductor on the Island Line Railway for the past three years, and found it continually grueling, inflexible and stifling. Sure, it was fun to go out on the middle of the lake via a causeway. At times, it felt like a magical place between the water and the sky. But that didn't make up for the hidebound rigidity of his supervisors, the lack of upward mobility, or the very low rate of pay.  He was looking for a change.</p>
    <p class="copy">While reading the newspaper on a bench in Battery Park &mdash; during one of the extremely rare afternoons he had off from what amounted to a seven-day work week &mdash;  Benjamin saw an ad for an exciting new prospect. A local company was seeking pneumatic pilots to undergo training on a new system of transport. Piloting and even maintenance sounded exciting, if it were in a new industry where he could make his mark.</p>
    <img src="./images/ad.jpg" />
    <p class="copy">A ship's horn sounded offshore, and his thoughts turned to Prudence Dawson, a girl he fancied. She worked as a full-time stewardess on the steamship Ticonderoga now coming into port. Thinking of his sweetheart Prudence and the way in which their unspoken mutual desire to marry had been hampered by the impecunious state of his bank account &mdash; all directly as a result of his current employment circumstances &mdash; he decided he would meet her as soon as her ship docked to discuss this new opportunity. He stood up, the paper clutched in his hands. A pneumatic pilot! Wouldn't that be something?</p>

    <h3>Sweethearts bicker before the fat lady sings.</h3>
    <h2>The Pilot &amp; The Stewardess - Howard Opera House - 6:53pm - July 13, 1894</h2>

    <p class="copy">Benjamin and Prudence were thrilled to be going to the opera &mdash; a rare treat facilitated by the uptick in Benjamin's fortunes resulting from his new occupation. The previous fall he had entered training to become a pneumatic pilot for what promised to be a thrilling new invention run by Queen City Pneumatic Transit. On the eve of the transit system's maiden run, the couple had decided to treat themselves to an outing together, to see and hear Jenny Lind, the Swedish Nightingale, when she made a tour stop on the shores of Lake Champlain en route to thrill Montréal.</p>
    <p class="copy">Prudence was dressed in her finest frock and wore it well, but she looked slightly uneasy as they took their seats and waited for the curtain to rise. She had something on her mind, as it turned out. "Ben, I had a very disturbing dream last night. True, I was sleeping in my berth on the boat again, and the Ticonderoga is not the most steady of beds on a windy evening, even in dock. I can't remember all of the dream, just the feeling of it. And I believe my dream was a premonition that the tube system could be dangerous under certain circumstances. Something had happened to you and your passengers, too...and I had a feeling that...well, it was very frightening." She pursed her lips and screwed up her courage to continue. "Ben, I was afraid in the dream that you were drowning! It was so real!"</p>
    <p class="copy">Ben guffawed and gazed at her adoringly. "Oh, Prue &mdash; I know you're capable &mdash; you basically run that boat's service staff &mdash; but you're so sweet, and so silly sometimes! I bet you can chalk this up to something your family gets from your mother's Irish side. Didn't you tell me your grandmother had once heard a banshee in the Old Country? I am sure the system is safe. We pilots have been training for many months, and we've run upwards of twenty test rides during that time, extending the run as soon as each section of the tube was built. And I myself witnessed the divers visiting and sealing the huge sections of glass tubing for the portion under the lake. It can't fail, my darling! It is the most modern of inventions, and Mr. Swan is a genius who thinks of everything!"</p>
    <p class="copy">Prudence was about to persist in defending her intuition, but had to clamp her jaw as the deep ruby velvet curtain began to rise upward, exposing Jenny Lind's twinkling slippers.</p>

    <h3>Big wheels turn in prime locations.</h3>
    <h2>The Inventor - Howard Opera House - 8:10pm - July 13, 1894</h2>

    <p class="copy">Charles T. Vanderman was a slight man, with an enormous presence. One could imagine him as a jovial youth, but in his senior years, he was direct in his objectives and little humored his companions. Someone who had clamored up the rungs of the ranks in all phases of his hard-driven life, he was finally enjoying his inarguable power. On this particular evening at the opera, Vanderman was accompanied by the timber king Abraham Ely Welles and long-time family friend, Gideon Collins.</p>
    <p class="copy">“Tell me Swan, when Burlington is the Timber Capital of the East, will your little miracle withstand the throngs?” rasped Mr. Welles through a thick puff of smoke. Welles, Collins and Swan were reminded of their lunchtime indulgence through a shared deep-belly laugh. Vanderman appeared more stoic than before. “Boys, I've got a fortune wrapped up in each of you. The last thing I need is a rose-tinted glimpse of Queen City. The figures need to add up. The public needs to buy in. I don't want to spend my old age down on Hudson... I want to see this town boom.” He looked down from the box at the primly dressed opera-goers, admiring the orderly fashion in which many were leaving their seats for intermission.</p>
    <p class="copy">Swan inched forward in his seat. A twinkle of persistence appeared in his eye as the gold-leafed walls reflected illumination on his white-collar-trimmed face. “Sir. This plan WILL be successful. It WILL promote the growth of Queen City. It WILL provide assets for your interests. I have no doubts.” Collins gave a nod of approval to Vanderman, clearly impressed by Swan's boldness. “Yes... then let's talk of tomorrow's inaugural event.” Collins put the men at ease by moving the conversation forward, knowing that the dawn of their decisions is upon them. No matter how they have hemmed and hawed in the past year, the morning next Queen City Pneumatic Transit would make its debut. Collins awkwardly removed a peppermint essence from his breast pocket, pressing it into his mouth.</p>
    <p class="copy">“Swan. If the system is to be successful, it is imperative that we woo &mdash;” he paused for a moment to enjoy the mint, emitting a quietly disgusting sucking sound, “&mdash; the investors tomorrow. We NEED that sugar capital or Queen City FAILS. Our future is literally riding on your tube car.” Irritated, Vanderman closed his eyes as the electric chandeliers flashed, a signal for the audience to return to their seats. “The only way we have them is if we can prove that the line is just as reliable as rail. With the advent of the chronometer last year, the kings think they are securing their throne. Perpetually.” Vanderman cleared his throat. “Collins, give him the short of it.” He relit the end of his cigar as the house lights went dark. His match cast an orange glow on the questioning face of Swan. “If your passenger car misses the mark at those stops by even a minute, the Sugar Men won't sign. The timetable needs to be met without fail.” There was now no color on or in Swan's face. A faint sucking sound came from Collins. Welles blurted, “God bless your pilots. Let us hope they understand how to ride the wind.”</p>

    <h2>The Inventor - Masonic Temple - 11:30pm - July 13, 1894</h2>

    <p class="copy">Four men dressed in tuxedos enter the Masonic Temple. A warm light shines from a high window in the peaked eaves. The soft glow is like a dull rainbow, the roof like an ancient pyramid. If any one had cast their eyes upward through the clutter of wires above Church Street, they may have noticed shadows dancing.  </p>

    <h3>The Excitement of Embarkation! Pneumatic Novelty!</h3>
    <h2>The Inventor - Battery Park - 9:07am - July 14, 1893</h2>

    <p class="copy">Despite the immense pressure Swan is under on this day, he had an odd sensation stirring within. His entire adult life, he suffered from a sense that something was gripping his heart. Sometimes, it would manifest as chest pain or a fire that he would douse with one herbal tonic or another. But today, he felt something different. It was as if the vice-grip on his heart was loosening. Like the carrot on the string was coming closer. A new dawn was upon him. As he handed the shears to Mayor Sanderson, an immense wash of pride filled his core, filtering into his extremities. His cheeks flushed as a young woman pushed to the front of the crowd to capture the moment on a handheld Kodak camera. Swan thought, “Yes. This is a New Age indeed.”</p>
